Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This repository contains code for fine-tuning a BERT-based sentiment classifier on the IMDB movie review dataset. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to adapt a pre-trained BERT model for binary sentiment classification (positive or negative) and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

Features
BERT Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Compute and visualize accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize classification performance.
Precision-Recall Curve: Analyze the trade-off between precision and recall.
Attention Weights Visualization: Examine the attention mechanisms of the model.
Example Predictions: View actual and predicted sentiment labels for sample reviews.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

torch
transformers
datasets
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers datasets scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the Repository:


The script will automatically download the IMDB dataset and initialize the BERT model. If you want to use a different dataset or model, you can modify the load_and_prepare_dataset and initialize_model_and_tokenizer functions, respectively.

Run the Training and Evaluation:

Execute the main script to start the fine-tuning process and evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This script will:

Load and preprocess the IMDB dataset.
Fine-tune the BERT model on the dataset.
Save the trained model and tokenizer.
Perform inference and generate evaluation metrics.
Plot confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, and attention weights.
Visualizations:

After training, you will find the following visualizations:

Confusion Matrix: Shows the performance of the model in classifying positive and negative sentiments.
Precision-Recall Curve: Depicts the trade-off between precision and recall at various threshold levels.
Attention Weights: Provides a snapshot of the attention weights for a sample input.
Coding Output: Displays actual and predicted movie reviews.
Code Structure
main.py: Main script for training and evaluation.
model.py: Contains functions for initializing the model, tokenizing data, and defining custom dataset class.
utils.py: Includes helper functions for plotting and metric calculations.
results/: Directory where model checkpoints and visualizations are saved.
